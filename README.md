# gsheets-st-readonly

Use Google Sheets as a backend to return a value using a query parameter of choice, hence readonly. 

Best to think of this as a key-value pair, though can be easily extended to do CRUD operations on gsheets as well.

Created for SST Tech Summit Lab School 2024, extendable to other use cases that uses a similar gsheets read-only setup
